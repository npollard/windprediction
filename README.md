windprediction
==============

Apply Bayes net machine learning algorithms to make short-term wind predictions. Research done with Dr. Ole Mengshoel at Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley.

# STRUCTURE
data - directory containing datasets grabbed from wundergound
models - directory containing Bayesian network models generating using Weka
results - directory containing output from running Weka's BayesNet classifier on the datasets and models
scripts - directory containing Python scripts that grab data from wunderground, preprocess the data, and run Weka's BayesNet on the models and data
